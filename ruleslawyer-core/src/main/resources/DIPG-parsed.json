A judge shouldn't intervene in a game unless they believe a violation has occurred, a player with a concern or question requests assistance, or the judge wishes to prevent a situation from escalating. Judges don't stop errors from occurring, but instead deal with errors that have occurred, penalize those who violate rules or policy, and promote fair play and sporting conduct by example and diplomacy. Judges may intervene to prevent or preempt errors occurring outside of a game. Knowledge of a player's history or skill does not alter an infraction, but it may be taken into account during an investigation.","subRules":[]}, {"text":"The purpose of a penalty is to educate the player not to make similar mistakes in the future.","subRules":[]}, {"text":"This is done through both an explanation of where the rules or policies were violated and a penalty to reinforce the education.

The Head Judge may not deviate from this guide's procedures except in significant and exceptional circumstances or a situation that has no applicable philosophy for guidance. The Rules Enforcement Level, round of the tournament, age or experience-level of the player, desire to educate the player, and certification level of the judge are NOT exceptional circumstances. If another judge feels deviation is appropriate, they must consult with the Head Judge.","subRules":[]}, {"text":"Judges are human and make mistakes. When a judge makes a mistake, they should acknowledge the mistake, apologize to the players, and fix it if it is not too late. If a member of the tournament staff gives a player erroneous information that causes them to commit a violation, the Head Judge is authorized to downgrade the penalty. For example, a player asks a judge whether a card is legal for a format and is told yes. When that player's deck is found to be illegal because of these cards, the Head Judge applies the normal procedure for fixing the decklist but may downgrade the penalty to a Warning because of the direct error of the judge.","subRules":[]}]}, {"text":"1.1.

A player issued a game loss should use the in-game concession function to end the game. If this loss does not end the match, the players should continue from the current state of the client. If the client is not currently in a game, the match should be restarted, then each player should concede games in order until the match score is correct. Then the player receiving the Game Loss penalty has the option to play or draw in the upcoming game."}, {"text":"If a Game Loss is issued before a match would begin (due to a player submitting an illegal decklist, for example), once the match begins the Player who received the Game Loss should concede Game 1 of their match.

Penalties are still issued even if a player drops from the tournament before it would take effect."}, {"text":"Any time a penalty is issued, the judge must explain the infraction, the procedure for fixing the situation, and the penalty to all players involved. If the Head Judge chooses to deviate from the Infraction Procedure Guide, the Head Judge is expected to explain the standard penalty and the reason for deviation. Some infractions include remedies to handle the offense beyond the base penalty. These procedures exist to protect officials from accusations of unfairness, bias, or favoritism. If a judge makes a ruling that is consistent with quoted text, then the complaints of a player shift from accusation of unfairness by the judge to accusations of unfair policy. Deviations from these procedures may raise accusations against the judge from the player(s) involved, or from those who hear about it. These procedures do not, and should not, take into account the game being played, the current situation that the game is in, or who will benefit strategically from the procedure associated with a penalty.
