[{"keywords":[""],"text":"Introduction","subRules":[{"keywords":[""],"text":"Most Magic players play for fun and see a tournament as a social event. Regular Rules Enforcement Level encourages a welcoming atmosphere and friendly competition. Your demeanor should reflect this, whether you are playing, judging or both. Players and judges are encouraged to help one another at appropriate times, such as during deck construction or between matches. Judges are the last word when a dispute or question arises, and we should be as impartial and diplomatic as possible.","subRules":[]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"Regular REL is many players' first experience of tournament Magic, so ensuring a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere is important. A player whose behaviour may be upsetting others or making them uncomfortable should be educated and asked to stop immediately. If they make no attempt to correct their behaviour, applying a Game Loss may reinforce the seriousness of the issue. If this does not stop the behaviour, or if a player is being threatening, aggressive or harassing other players, these situations are Serious Problems.","subRules":[]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"Magic is a complicated game. While we can't prevent players from making mistakes, we should do our best to fix situations as fairly as possible. It is important that players know that when help is needed or something goes wrong, calling a judge is the best course of action. Our solutions should focus on educating the players and keeping the game going rather than worrying about the impact on the game. You should intervene if you see something illegal happen in a match, but beyond this you can exercise your discretion. For example, whether you step in when you see a player miss a trigger should be determined by the tone you want to strike for your event - it may be appropriate to provide this extra help in a more causal environment, but less so if your play group is more competitive.","subRules":[]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"When answering a question, double check the rules if you aren't sure of your answer. Remember to give the players extra time to finish their match to compensate for time taken by a ruling. The fixes found in the Infraction Procedure Guide are designed for a stricter environment and don't apply at Regular REL. If a player accidentally breaks a rule, use the remedies described below and your common sense as guidance to make the best ruling you can. If you feel that the suggested remedy is not suitable to your particular situation you may suggest a more appropriate fix which is applied if both players accept it. Player education is a priority; remind the players to play more carefully, but avoid being heavy-handed in order to keep your events fun and relaxed. If a player continues to repeat a mistake despite multiple reminders, you may warn them that the next occurrence will result in a Game Loss. Hopefully this final step will not be required, but knowing it is possible should get the player to correct their behavior. Knowingly breaking a rule is a Serious Problem (see below).","subRules":[]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"If your event requires deck lists, provides large prizes, or is otherwise of a more competitive nature, it may be better to run it at Competitive rather than Regular REL.

If the ability includes the word \"may,\" assume the player chose not to perform it. Otherwise, put the ability on the stack unless you think it would be too disruptive - don't add it to the stack if significant decisions have been made based on the effect not happening! Unlike other illegal actions (which must be pointed out), players may choose whether or not to point out their opponent's missed triggers."}]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"A player sees a card in a library that they shouldn't have seen","subRules":[{"keywords":[""],"text":"Shuffle the card seen into the unknown portion of the library.

Otherwise, determine how many extra cards have been drawn, take that many cards at random from the player's hand and place them on top of the library. Don't shuffle the library after doing this!

If the error involved a player forgetting to draw or discard cards, have them perform the appropriate action now."}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"Otherwise, if the error was caught quickly and rewinding is relatively easy, you may undo all the actions back to the point that the illegal action happened. This can include returning random cards from the hand to the library to undo card draws (though don't shuffle the library if you do this), untapping permanents and undoing combat. This can be very disruptive where lots of decisions have been made or hidden information has been revealed since the illegal action, so don't go crazy with this!"}]}, {"keywords":[""],"text":"A player has illegal, insufficient, or another player's cards in their deck","subRules":[{"keywords":[""],"text":"Remove any cards that shouldn't be in the deck, put back any cards that should, then add basic lands of the player's choice if the deck is below the format's minimum size limit. Any cards that are added to the deck should be shuffled directly into the library. If the error was discovered during a draw effect, have the player complete the draw effect after the deck is fixed and shuffled.
