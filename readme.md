**About**

RulesLawyer is a Discord application for installing in Magic: The Gathering-related servers, and is meant to be used as a "search engine" through various Magic rules documents. It is one of the "Early Verified Bots" of Discord.

This Github repository is simply for portfolio-building; it does not accept PRs and cannot be run without certain permissions that are not included. It may also be outdated; it is likely that the currently running version does not match the code here, since I'm pretty forgetful at actually `git push`ing.

The application will not run locally without an API key with access to my personal development server. However, use of RulesLawyer is free to anyone. The installation link is below.
